## DeepFake Video Detector

This project is a **Python-based DeepFake Video Detector** designed to identify manipulated videos using advanced machine learning techniques. It includes a fully responsive web interface built with HTML and CSS, making it accessible and user-friendly for non-technical users. The system allows users to upload video files, analyze their content for potential deepfake manipulation, and receive clear, detailed reports of the results.

## Features

- **Video Frame Extraction**: Automatically extracts frames from uploaded video files to analyze them individually.
- **DeepFake Detection**: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to scan extracted frames and identify signs of manipulation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A visually appealing and responsive web interface facilitates easy interaction for uploading videos and viewing results.
- **Report Generation**: Provides results in a detailed, easy-to-understand format, highlighting key findings.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The web interface works seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Optional:

- Virtual environment for Python

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detector.git
   cd deepfake-detector
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install all required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the Python Backend Server:**
   Launch the Flask application to handle detection and API requests:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Web Interface

The web interface is designed to provide an intuitive experience for users. To run it:

1. Navigate to the `web/` folder:
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser, or host it locally:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000` using your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Start the Backend Server:**
   Run the Flask backend by executing:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface:**
   Open the `index.html` file in your browser, or use a local server to serve the page.

3. **Upload a Video:**
   Use the "Upload" button to select a video file for analysis.

4. **Analyze the Video:**
   Click "Analyze" to start the detection process. The application will extract frames, analyze them, and display the results.

5. **View Results:**
   Review the detailed report generated by the system on the web interface.

## Future Plans

We aim to enhance the system with the following features:

- **Real-Time Video Stream Analysis:**
  Enable real-time detection of deepfakes from live video streams.

- **Improved Model Accuracy:**
  Integrate state-of-the-art neural networks for higher detection accuracy.

- **Visualization Tools:**
  Provide graphical representations of the analysis results, such as heatmaps or confidence levels.

- **API Integration:**
  Develop a public API for third-party developers to integrate deepfake detection capabilities into their applications.
